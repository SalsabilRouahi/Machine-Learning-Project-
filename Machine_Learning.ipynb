Such literature reviews are not perfect because they can be subject to several biases and are inherently dependent on the original study's data quality.Yet, an even bigger hindrance to the pooling of results and synthesis of actionable conclusions is heterogeneity-comparing apples with oranges.Some degree of heterogeneity is inevitable, with variations in methodology, clinical practice, and patient populations; however, when possible, standardization with core outcome sets (COSs) can be a readily modifiable source of heterogeneity.Developed with validated methods that aim to honor the diverse interests of multiple stakeholders, structured COSs can facilitate more efficient research, greater consistency in the collection of meaningful endpoints, and more effective quality assessments of both the literature and healthcare. Enhanced structure may be particularly important for conditions with variable presentation and management, such as ectopic pregnancy.Chong et al. (1) have highlighted the variance in the defining and reporting of outcomes for ectopic pregnancy research.This is compounded by the fact that there can be ambiguity in its clinical presentation and management.Classically, an ectopic pregnancy could be diagnosed by a positive b-human chorionic gonadotropin level and a transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) showing a round anechoic adnexal structure outlined by an echogenic ringthe ''bagel sign.''What about the patient with vaginal spotting and an early positive home pregnancy test result who has been trying to conceive for nearly a year and now has a TVUS with not only no bagel sign but also no evidence of an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP)?A pregnancy of unknown location puts the patient at a crossroad in terms of management because the underlying diagnosis could be one of several things: an early normal intrauterine pregnancy (that could be interrupted by ectopic pregnancy treatment), a resolving miscarriage, or a small ectopic pregnancy that is yet to become visible (but could still cause life-threatening hemorrhage at any size); plateauing values over several days of serial b-human chorionic gonadotropin monitoring may lead a provider to presumptively treat a pregnancy as an ectopic pregnancy, even in the absence of definitive TVUS findings.The significant variation in the presentation of these ectopic pregnancy examples underscores some of the difficulties in treating and studying such abnormal pregnancies; nevertheless what is very clearly known is the potential for high morbidity and even mortality in ectopic pregnancy cases.Thus, Chong et al. (1) emphasized an aim of generating a core set of universal outcome measures that can be used regardless of the scenario in which the ectopic pregnancy is diagnosed.In an uncertain clinical scenario, COSs facilitate reflection on the effectiveness of treatment outcomes in a more structured way to better inform individualized, risk-minimizing patient care and future studies. Yet, the harmonization of COSs requires thoughtful optimizing because they are only as good as their ability to be implemented and the appropriateness of their measures.The study by Chong et al. (1) reflects some of these limitations.Their final COS excludes variables pertaining to the psychological and economic impact of ectopic pregnancy (domains 5 and 6) because these did not meet consensus, although individuals with lived experience assigned a higher value to these domains (a mean score of 7.5, compared with 6.7 and 5.5 among healthcare professionals and researchers, respectively) (1) .Additionally, although the study recruited stakeholders worldwide, there was suboptimal representation from African (1%) and South American (<1%) developing countries compared with that from developed European (58%) countries and no variables examining access to care (1) .Pregnancy is an intimate condition, and patients' lives, feelings, and circumstances outside of the doctor's office or the trial setting may heavily influence their outcomes. These more qualitative variables provide important context.For instance, it is difficult to accurately compare treatment failures, resolution times, or adverse events without examining treatment availability and compliance.Consider a variety of patients who fail methotrexate treatment and represent with ectopic rupture requiring emergent surgery.One patient received therapy but missed a necessary second dose because of a prohibitive travel distance to the clinic and the inability to procure childcare.Another patient lived in a state with vaguely worded abortion laws and was subject to a critical delay in medication due to challenges in interpreting legislative exceptions.A third patient presented late to care because of significant healthcare anxiety and despite being a less-than-ideal candidate, opted for medical management hoping to avoid costly surgery.There are endless variations to these scenarios, demonstrating that differences in ectopic pregnancy treatment failure, resolution time, and complications may depend on the context in which treatment was provided, rather than purely reflecting on the treatment itself.Attention to such healthcare disparities is critical because racial/ethnic and economic minorities are disproportionately affected by ectopic pregnancy and are at greater risk for associated complications (2) .The important work by Chong et al. ( 1) is an excellent foundation upon which future efforts can be made to identify and reconcile the values of even more diverse stakeholders.However, to be effective, even a perfectly curated COS must overcome the challenge of implementation.The study by Chong et al. ( 1) is strengthened by the investigators' rigorously structured consensus methodology and careful attention to defining the final core outcomes to help reproducibility and optimize application; they also made efforts to diversify their steering committees and stakeholders to yield generalizable, meaningful outcomes.Their results are publicly available in the expanding Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials Initiative database.In certain fields, uptake of COSs has been very successful; for instance, a study using the clinical trials registry showed that uptake of the rheumatoid arthritis COS has increased over time, now with more than 80% of trials in this field reporting data on the full set (3).Yet, despite readily available COSs in a growing range of health areas, several studies have demonstrated that there is still wide variation in uptake, particularly for patientreported outcomes (4, 5) .One study surveyed trialists, revealing that few had ever received education about COSs or been involved in COS development; most of them cited a lack of awareness of existing COSs, preference for trialspecific outcomes, or concerns about executing COS measurement as barriers to their inclusion in trials (4) .A study of patient-reported outcomes highlighted the impracticality of some lengthy patient questionnaires and the limited scope of disease-specific variables as obstacles to uptake (5) .Perhaps by standardizing variables that can be readily collected within the usual clinical workflow, COS uptake can be made more practical to guide clinical decision making in real time and reduce the collection burden on trialists. Ultimately, whether studying any aspect of reproductive health or medicine, it is clear that COSs are an important part of modern healthcare and research; however, there is room for growth in the development, distribution, and implementation of COSs to maximize their use and benefits. VOL. 119 NO. 5 / MAY 2023\",\n          \"Beyond awareness \\u2013 National Infertility Awareness Week 2023  Each year during National Infertility Awareness Week, we strive to educate the public on the impact of infertility.This year, we must also commit to educate ourselves.Advocacy efforts have contributed to important policy changes aimed at expanding access; however, many individuals in the United States with impaired fertility remain not only untreated but undiagnosed.Although the prevalence of infertility does not differ by race according to the most recent analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, women of color are less likely to complete the infertility workup and have lower rates of utilization of fertility treatment.Black women, in particular, report the highest levels of unmet reproductive goals and the lowest levels of reproductive success.The existence of racial disparities in access to fertility care in the United States has been well described in the literature for >2 decades, yet the roots of these inequities remain understudied and unaddressed. As with most health disparities work in its infancy, the focus on disparities in infertility has been on access and outcomes thus far.Multiple analyses of data collected from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinic Outcomes Reporting System suggest that Black women experience lower success rates after fertility treatments, compared with non-Hispanic White women.Population-based analyses like these, as well as those from clinical practices, only include the subset of Black women who were able to attain access to assisted reproductive technology-excluding the large population of women who were never diagnosed, evaluated, or treated. The most often-cited explanation for the profound gap in access to fertility care is the high costs and financial stress associated with fertility treatment.Most patients who undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF) in the United States lack insurance coverage for fertility treatment.When coverage is available, certain types of fertility services (e.g., testing) are more likely to be covered than others (e.g., IVF).As a result, many individuals pay out of their pockets for their medical treatment, which can be substantial, given that the median price of an IVF cycle in the United States is reported to be $19,200 (1) . To date, this economic barrier has been the primary target of efforts to address disparities in access.Many believe that providing financial support in the form of state-mandated insurance coverage for infertility treatment would be the ''solution''-resulting in the demographics of women receiving care being more representative of the general population.Unfortunately, multiple studies have found that racial disparities persist in enhanced or equal access to care models (e.g., in Massachusetts, a state with mandated and comprehensive insurance coverage of fertility treatment) suggesting that access alone is not the problem.Despite state law-mandated insurance coverage for fertility care in 19 states, fertility services continue to be primarily accessed by highly educated, wealthy, White women.The initiatives to reduce economic barriers are necessary but insufficient to address the inequity in access to fertility care.Even in the United Kingdom, where fertility services are publicly funded, women from minority populations face significant challenges when seeking fertility care.Clearly, a better understanding of the ''noneconomic'' barriers impacting a woman's decision to seek treatment will need to be the focus of future attempts to ameliorate the prevailing disparities.Although there is some literature examining cultural and societal factors that impede access to fertility care in the United States, these studies have overwhelmingly considered the experiences of White women.If we want to make progress toward equity, we must center our efforts on the living reality of those who experience the greatest inequities. Black women have the lowest rates of utilization of fertility treatment and wait approximately 20 months longer than White women to access care.Qualitative studies have offered some insight into the individual factors contributing to this delay (e.g., psychobiological and sociocultural barriers) (2), but the institutional and structural factors that affect access to fertility services are largely unexplored.Black women are not deciding whether to seek fertility care in a vacuum; in addition to current social conditions, the historical context of systemic racism continues to shape their decision-making and reproductive health. The pervasive stereotype that Black women are hyperfertile, which was used to justify many atrocities, continues to cause harm today.Consciously or unconsciously, these falsehoods affect how Black women view themselves and how others view them.Internalized stigma may delay a woman's decision to seek fertility care, while implicit and explicit physician bias can also lead to medical gatekeeping (3).Prejudice regarding who can suffer from infertility and who deserves to be a parent influences how Black women are counseled about their fertility, perpetuating disparities in patient knowledge, awareness, and access to care. To meaningfully narrow the existing gaps, concerted efforts are needed to systematically examine the multifaceted causes of these inequities.Rather than starting with the disparity (utilization of fertility care) and ''working backward'' to investigate the differential disease characteristics and interactions with the health system that immediately precede the differential outcome, we also need to take a ''topdown'' approach.Along with an individual's identity, the greater social, political, and structural context determines the exposures they experience throughout their life.These exposures, in turn, influence the differential disease characteristics and interactions with the health system (4). Health equity frameworks highlight the need for interventions that move beyond the individual level.The reproductive justice framework, for example, uses intersectionality theory to consider the societal, institutional, and systemic contexts within which individuals make reproductive decisions (5) .Created by Black women as a more inclusive model for all women nearly 3 decades ago, reproductive justice rests on 4 core tenets: every person is endowed with the human right to bodily autonomy; have children; not have children; and parent their children in safe, sustainable communities.The framework was born out of debates on the right to access contraception and abortion care, specifically the shortcomings of the ''choice'' movement.Recently, with the increasing awareness of racial disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality, there has been more focus on the tenets of bodily autonomy and the right to parent; however, the right to have a child (specifically, access to fertility care) has not garnered much attention. Although now is an especially critical time to advocate for access to safe abortion and obstetric care, it is also incumbent on us to prioritize our efforts to achieve equity in fertility care.To do so, multipronged efforts to understand and improve the social, political, and structural context in which our patients live and make decisions will be necessary.In other words, we need to start at the roots of the inequity, and we need to start now. During National Infertility Awareness Week, we aim to empower the public through increased understanding and awareness; this ''education'' should be bidirectional.We must assign greater value to the patient's experience and the patient's voice, with particular attention to feedback from the communities that are underserved by our field.This also means funding and prioritizing research that, rather than simply identifying disparities, works to understand their causes.Additionally, we need to develop interventions to address these causes and allow us to move toward equity. By doing this, we move beyond being part of the problem and move toward being partners in creating a solution. Fertility and Sterility\\u00ae\",\n          \"Interventions for uterine fibroids: an overview of Cochrane Reviews This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Overview).The objectives are as follows: The objective is to summarize evidence from Cochrane Reviews on the e ectiveness and safety of treatment options available to premenopausal women with uterine fibroid-associated symptoms. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Uterine fibroids (also known as leiomyomas and myomas; UFs) are benign lesions or neoplasms of the uterus that are composed of smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts and are rich in extracellular matrix.They may cause heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding that can lead to chronic anaemia.Uterine fibroids can also enlarge the uterus and this enlargement can lead to 'bulk symptoms' -for example, urinary symptoms (such as increased urinary frequency, nocturia, urgency incontinence or urinary retention) or gastrointestinal symptoms (such as diarrhoea or constipation)in addition to abdominal distention or acyclic pelvic pain.These symptoms may considerably impair women's quality of life (Moroni 2014) .Whilst ultrasonography studies show prevalence rates of uterine fibroids to exceed 70%, clinical fibroid symptoms are felt in 25% to 50% of all women; these data represent a self-report diagnosis of 12.8 per 1000 person-years to 2 per 1000 person-years for hysterectomy-confirmed cases in the USA (Whiteman 2010) .The most recurrent risk factor reported to increase the fibroid risk is black race, followed by increasing age (until the perimenopausal transition), premenopausal state, hypertension, family history and others (Stewart 2017) .Fibroids may also a ect a woman's fertility; it is known that uterine fibroids may cause cavity distortion and alteration of endometrial receptivity (Whynott 2017) , and this may or may not cause symptoms. Pelvic ultrasonography remains the primary imaging modality for the diagnosis of uterine fibroids, owing to the benefits of wide availability and low cost associated with this test, in addition to the reliable identification of calcified fibroids and the detection of larger, clinically relevant fibroids.Sensitivity and specificity for ultrasonography are 90% and 87%, respectively, and are improved with the addition of sonohysterography (instilling saline into the uterine cavity through the cervix) (up to 100% and 98%, respectively).Magnetic resonance imaging presents the highest sensitivity and specificity indexes for UF diagnosis (Stewart 2016) . Uterine fibroids seem to develop and regulate gene expression in response to menstrual cyclicity and the action of gonadal steroids (mainly oestrogen and progesterone); they induce symptomatology between first occurrence of menstruation (menarche) and menopause.The fibroid pathogenesis comprises multiple stages, starting with the recruitment of a smooth muscle stem cell from the myometrium that lacks receptors for the gonadal steroids (Bulun 2013).Under the influence of specific driver mutations, in addition to oestrogen, progesterone, and the activation of a protein named beta-catenin within a signalling pathway named wingless-type (WNT), the stem cell di erentiates into a preclinical fibroid.Subsequently, four key cell types that comprise fibroids (smooth muscle cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts and fibroid-associated fibroblasts) (Holdsworth-Carson 2014) and the extracellular matrix synergize with environmental and molecular stimuli to undergo growth acceleration and progression into clinical disease (Stewart 2016) . There are a number of potential uterine-sparing interventions for uterine fibroids.Choice of a particular intervention will be dependent upon the chief complaint, i.e.: heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, bulk symptoms, infertility or a combination of symptoms.The following interventions have been studied with regard to their e ect on treating uterine fibroids (in alphabetical order). Surgical interventions and most of the medical treatments aim both to control heavy menstrual bleeding and to improve bulk symptoms.The mechanisms of the control of heavy menstrual bleeding are not well understood but may include physical normalization of the endometrial cavity, or may be related to control of angiogenic factors (Stewart 1996) .Likewise, bulk symptoms have historically been thought to require volume reduction, and minimally invasive techniques such as uterine artery embolization have brought improvements to quality of life (Keung 2018) .More invasive procedures may present more adverse e ects.Recently, a selective progesterone receptor modulator (ulipristal acetate) has been extensively studied with regard to relieving moderate to severe symptoms in women with uterine fibroids (Garnock-Jones 2017), however the endometrial safety for extended treatment needs further investigation (De Milliano 2017) . There are now many systematic reviews of interventions available on the medical and surgical treatment of uterine fibroids for improving heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, bulk symptoms or infertility (or a combination of these).In the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, there are 13 systematic reviews available on these topics.It is important to bring these documents together into one coherent review that can be used by clinicians, policy makers and women with fibroids when making decisions about optimal treatment based on the available evidence about uterine fibroids. The objective is to summarize evidence from Cochrane Reviews on the e ectiveness and safety of treatment options available to premenopausal women with uterine fibroid-associated symptoms. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Only Cochrane Reviews, protocols and titles will be considered for inclusion in this overview.At the time of writing, systematic reviews on the following topics have been published with regard to uterine fibroids (in alphabetical order).We will list in an additional table any titles or protocols that we identify during our searches, and will incorporate data from these in future versions of the overview. We will include premenopausal, symptomatic women with a clinical or imaging diagnosis (or both) of uterine fibroids, who have sought medical attention for heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain or bulk symptoms (or a combination of these) or for infertility (regardless of symptoms). Medical, complementary therapies or surgical interventions will be considered.Medical treatment can be used as a single intervention or administered before or a er surgery, or both.Eligible comparators include placebo or another treatment. Whilst pelvic pain/bulk symptoms secondary to uterine fibroids might not have been as extensively investigated as those for heavy menstrual bleeding, it is expected that some participants would have presented with both symptoms and it is important to seek the interventions for this specific outcome.Medical/complementary therapies or surgical interventions will be considered in all reviews. Medical or surgical interventions will be included for this variable. Primary outcome measure: improvement, measured by self-report (qualitative measures such as symptom-free, better, the same or worse) or by use of a health-related quality-of-life instrument.One of the quality-of-life measurements mostly used for uterine fibroids is the use of standardized, validated, specific questionnaires such as the UFS-QOL tool (Spies 2002) for measuring improvement of patients a er being treated.Other generic questionnaires (e.g. SF-36 -McHorney 1993) could also be used.Measurement by haemoglobin, haematocrit and ferritin levels, reduction in PBAC (pictorial blood assessment chart) scores and reduction in the number of bleeding episodes (by number of pads/day) will also be investigated. Primary outcome measure: improvement, measured by self-report (yes/no, Likert scales or numeric scales) or by use of a healthrelated quality-of-life instrument or by a quantitative instrument, such as a visual analogue scale (VAS), or improvement with a specific questionnaire such as UFSQOL. Primary outcome measures: bloating, pelvic pressure/discomfort, constipation, frequent urination, pain during intercourse measured by qualitative measures (yes/no, or Likert scales). Reduction in fibroid volume or uterine volume, measured by pelvic ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging; presence of adverse e ects secondary to treatment (vasomotor symptoms, bone density, laboratorial changes, acne, weight gain, bloating, breast tenderness, headache, nausea); recurrence rate. Primary outcome measures: live birth (number of live births per woman); clinical pregnancies (pregnancy diagnosed by ultrasound visualization of one or more gestational sacs or definitive clinical signs of pregnancy); ongoing pregnancies (pregnancy progressing beyond 12 weeks of gestation). Secondary outcome: miscarriage (spontaneous loss of a clinical pregnancy before 20 weeks of gestation or less than 400 g of fetal weight). The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews will be searched using the keyword \\\"uterine fibroids\\\" (leiomyoma is not a term that is used in this database).The term will be restricted to title, abstract or keywords.No other databases will be searched. Cochrane Reviews addressing treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding, bulk symptoms or for infertility associated with uterine fibroids will be identified by one overview author (SOC) and checked by a second overview author (LGOB).Any disagreement will be resolved by consensus or discussion with a third party (WPM). Data will be extracted independently by two overview authors (LGOB, SOC) using an Excel spreadsheet.We will follow the LGOB: none known ES: Dr Stewart reports the following: has received consulting fees from Bayer, AbbVie, Allergan and Myovant and serves on a steering committee for a fibroid trial for Myovant.She also received payment for developing an educational presentation from Med Learning Group, receives royalties from UpToDate, and has a patent ( 6440445\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 3,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2,\n          1,\n          3\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In 2012, approximately 350,000 adverse pregnancy outcomes worldwide were attributed to syphilis, of these 40% were early fetal deaths/stillbirths, 18% neonatal deaths, 13% preterm/lowbirthweight babies and 29% infected infants (Wijesooriya 2016) .The majority of adverse perinatal outcomes (87%) were seen in Africa and Asia.Approximately 66% of all adverse outcomes occurred in women who had attended antenatal care and who were not tested or were not treated for syphilis (Newman 2013) .Syphilis infects 1% or more of antenatal care attendees in over 55 countries (WHO 2016) .The severity of adverse outcomes associated with congenital syphilis is usually determined by the length of the maternal infection as well as the stage of pregnancy; in the early stages, the spirochetaemia (presence of spirochetes in the blood) is higher, therefore fetus infection is more frequent.Mothers with primary syphilis can transmit the infection to the fetus in 70% to 100% of cases, with secondary infection in 90%, and with latent syphilis in 30% (Berman 2004) .Women screened and treated in the first two trimesters of their pregnancy are more likely to have a healthy infant, compared to women screened and treated in the third trimester (odds ratio (OR) 2.24; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 3.93) (Hawkes 2013) .Thus, diagnosis and treatment of syphilis must be carried out early in the pregnancy. Syphilis testing and treatment can e ectively prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes related to syphilis; neonates who survive with congenital syphilis are at risk of congenital anomalies, active syphilis, and longer-term sequelae, including deafness and neurologic impairment (Gloyd 2001) . In 2007, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a strategy for the elimination of congenital syphilis as a public health problem through reduction of the prevalence of syphilis in pregnant women and the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of syphilis.This strategy rests on four distinct pillars, namely: (1) ensuring sustained political commitment and advocacy; (2) increasing access to, and quality of, maternal and newborn health services; (3) screening of all pregnant women and treatment of all positive cases and their partner; and (4) establishing surveillance, monitoring and evaluation systems.To eliminate mother-to-child transmission of syphilis, countries should test at least 95% of pregnant women for syphilis at the first antenatal control visit (WHO 2007) . The diagnosis of syphilis is suspected by clinical presentation, or by the risk factors of infection.Most patients do not have symptoms or signs at presentation, and the diagnosis has to be made by diagnostic test.The treponemal infection produces an inflammatory response in which the damaged host cells release lipoproteins such as cardiolipins and lecithin, the non-treponemal test detects these substances, but can produce a false-positive reaction with some clinical conditions such as collagen diseases, antiphospholipid syndrome, other treponemical infections (for example, pian, leprosy), as well as pregnancy (Cohen 2013 ).The sensitivity is higher in secondary (100%) and latent syphilis (96% to 98%), but the sensitivity is lower in primary (78% to 86%, darkfield confirmed cases as this was mentioned in (Creegan 2007) , and in late syphilis (71% to 73%).The specificity of the test is 98% in all stages, compared with the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination (TPHA) test (Naidu 2012) .The reports of the non-treponemal test are in dilutions or in titres, the higher the production of antibodies, the higher the titres; a result of 1:8 titres is very suggestive of recent or active infection. People with syphilis develop specific antibodies against treponema.The detection of these antibodies can be made by di erent techniques such as fluorescent agglutination, hemagglutination or chemiluminescence, which comprise the treponemal test, and the more o en used are: the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed (FTA-ABS) test, Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) assay, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and chemiluminescence immunoassay (CIA).These test have a moderate sensitivity in primary syphilis (84% to 96%), and a high sensitivity in the other stages; and they have high specificity (98%) in all stages.The result is either positive or negative (Naidu 2012) . Due to the importance of infection in pregnancy, given the risk of infection to the fetus, all pregnant women are screened for syphilis infection.The traditional algorithm of diagnosis begins with a non-treponemal test, and if this test is positive, the infection is confirmed with a treponemal test (CDC 2014; PAHO 2015; WHO 2007) .As the non-treponemal tests have false-positive results, and low titles have to be confirmed, with a delay in the diagnosis, some authors recommend the reverse algorithm (PAHO 2015) .This strategy consists in first performing the treponemal test, if it is positive, given its high specificity, antibiotic treatment is started and the non-treponemal test is requested to confirm the infection activity (CDC 2008) . The diagnosis of syphilis is made when the pregnant women has clinical signs of infection, such as chancre, skin ulcer, or rash, and the non-treponemal and treponemal syphilis tests are reactive.The most common clinical scenario is the absence of symptoms, in this case the diagnosis of active or recent infection is made when the two tests are positive.In the non-active syphilis or immunological memory, only the treponemal tests are positive.When only the nontreponemal test is positive, it is considered to be a false positive for infection (PAHO 2015) . Treponemal tests require more technology and are more expensive, therefore, they are not available in all healthcare settings (Peeling 2004) .In some countries or healthcare settings, when the diagnosis begins with the non-treponemal test, if the test is positive, the prenatal control personnel will request the treponemal test.However, due to the di iculties mentioned with this test, many patients do not return for the result and the patient is le without the appropriate treatment for the infection (Jafari 2013) .This results in cases of congenital syphilis, which could have been avoided.In low-and middle-income countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, roughly one out of three women is not tested for syphilis during pregnancy, with wide variations from country to country (WHO 2014). Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. In pregnancy, it is necessary to make a timely diagnosis of all pathologies that a ect the mother or the fetus.Perinatal infections cause severe lesions in the fetus that produce sequelae in neonates.When gestational syphilis is diagnosed and treated early, the fetal morbidity and mortality decrease significantly (Hawkes 2013) . In order to improve the opportunity for diagnosis, rapid diagnosis tests (RDTs) have been developed.These tests consist of a kit, with all the necessary components included, and they can be applied anywhere, by a trained person.The RDT applied at the point of care (POC) has made syphilis testing possible even in remote settings (WHO 2016 B), because they do not need refrigeration or laboratory equipment.The syphilis RDTs use for diagnosis, a drop of blood, that can be obtained by puncture of one finger, and they provide results in 10 to 15 minutes (Jafari 2013) expressed in a qualitative way (positive or negative). The RDTs developed for syphilis are treponemal and non-treponemal.The technology base of the test is inmunochromatographic or agglutinant.A positive treponemic test indicates an old or recent infection.The non-treponemal test indicates an active infection.Studies with RDTs (treponemal and non-treponemal) show a specificity from 94% to more than 99% and a sensitivity between 60% to 100%, depending on the test (Gaydos 2014; Jafari 2013 ).In the prenatal control clinic, it is advisable not to miss the opportunity of treatment of gestational syphilis, therefore in a patient with a positive treponemal test, it is important to start antibiotic treatment as soon as possible (Binnicker 2012) .This strategy could result in over-treatment as a result of false positives due to old infections, but is less dangerous than the secondary risk of not treating the infection in pregnant women (Jafari 2013) .In highprevalence gestational syphilis communities, the combined tests may significantly reduce over-treatment (Greer 2008) .Another test, that is very useful in pregnancy is the HIV/syphilis Duo test, that is a method of qualitative detection of both infections, by inmunochromatography to detect immunoglobulin (Ig) IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies for specific-HIV antigens and the Treponema pallidum recombinant antigen in serum (Bristow 2016; Gait\\u00e1n-Duarte 2016) . In some settings these RDTs could be more cost-e ective in screening and treating syphilis than laboratory-based testing methods such as the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) or venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test (Terris-Prestholt 2015).The implementation of rapid testing must be accompanied by quality assurance systems and technical competence (Benzaken 2014) .Currently there are numerous commercial trades for POC tests, being the most commonly used the Abbott Determine, Omega Visitect, Qualpro Syphicheck, Standard Bioline and Trinity Syphilis Health Check (Mabey 2006) In recent meta-analysis the sensitivity of treponemal POC tests varied form 74.26% to 90.04% and specificity from 94.15% to 99.58% (Jafari 2013) .The combined test has a sensitivity of 98.4% when the standard is a non-treponemal test (RPR) greater than 1:8 dilutions, but it has been seen that sensitivity falls to 88% when RPR is negative (Singh 2015) .Nevertheless, these recent analysis are made with studies that use frozen samples with the serologic status already known (STD clinic attendees, female sex workers and antenatal clinic attendees) and a majority used a TP specific reference standard, resulting in high sensitivities and specificities, inducing biases during the process.Our review will include only studies in pregnant women made on the field, with fresh samples (Jafari 2013)  The diagnosis of gestational syphilis, early in pregnancy is very important, in order to prevent congenital syphilis.The majority of pregnant women with syphilis are in the latent stage of infection, so they do not present symptoms or signs.The diagnosis is based on laboratory tests (Cohen 2013) .It is known that prevention of mother-to-child syphilis transmission is feasible, even in low-resource settings.In pregnant women, early screening and detection of syphilis with a rapid treatment for positive patients will prevent transmission to the child (CDC 2008; Taylor 2017 ).Based on this, in 2011 the WHO launched strategies for prevention of congenital syphilis (WHO 2007) .In some places, it is not possible to perform or to wait for the results of a laboratory test, therefore diagnosis depends on the availability of RDTs, and their use at POC helps to improve early detection and they contribute to achieving this goal (Peeling 2010) .The RDT for syphilis can be implemented by clinicians under di erent scenarios regardless of healthcare levels, covering a broad patient spectrum. In prenatal control clinics, the diagnosis of syphilis can be made, beginning with non-treponemal test, and then confirming with the treponemal test.Syphilis is diagnosed, when the two tests are positive.In recent years, some countries have used the inverse algorithm, beginning with the treponemal test, followed by the non-treponemal test to determine the activity of the disease.The RDT is a treponemal test that could be done at the POC, and the results obtained in the same prenatal control visit.A positive treponemal RDT confirms the diagnosis of old or active syphilis and the necessary treatment must be applied.In addition, in the same consultation, the non-treponemal test should be requested, to know the activity of the infection, and then to continue the treatment according to the stage of syphilis (Binnicker 2012) .A negative treponemal RDT, rejects the diagnosis of infection, and control with rapid treponemal test should be continued, each trimester of gestation.When the patient has had one positive treponemal test, the control has to be carried out with a nontreponemal test. The introduction of a rapid test for syphilis in pregnant women, in low-and middle-income countries, has resulted in substantial increases in antenatal syphilis testing (Swartzendruber 2015) .Studies in six countries found significant increases in the proportion of pregnant women screened for syphilis from pre-to postintroduction of screening: Per\\u00fa from 61% to 100% (Flores 2014) ; Kenya from 18% to 70% (Fleming 2013) ; Uganda from 1.7% to 90.3%; Zambia from 79.9% to 95.6% (Strasser 2012) ; Tanzania 17.8% to 100% (Mabey 2012) ; and Cambodia from 0% to 77% (Delvaux 2011) .In India, a prospective cross-sectional study, showed an increased proportion of pregnant women screened for HIV, syphilis and Hepatitis B from 9% to 96% (Pai 2012) . The WHO sexually transmitted infections (STI) guidelines recommend treatment for early and late congenital syphilis, considering the associated burden and economic costs.Consequently, it is highly desirable to undertake a critical appraisal Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews of the available evidence of the diagnostic accuracy of the di erent RDTs.There is therefore, a need for high-quality systematic reviews to improve the diagnosis of syphilis.This systematic review will facilitate the synthesis of the current evidence, and recognise the strengths and weaknesses, address the uncertainty of the current knowledge and make it possible to assess the e ectiveness and safety of this intervention. The most recent systematic review that evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of the rapid POC tests concluded that immunochromatographic tests such as Determine and Sd Bioline Syphilis 3.0 are acceptable options in antenatal testing for syphilis (Rogozinska 2017) .Nevertheless, there is a need for a systematic review that strengthens these findings.One of the main limitations of Rogozinska 2017 systematic review was the broad limits for the search, wide enough to be less practical.Another limitation was the bivariate analysis applied only in the RPR, weakened by a marked heterogeneity of sensitivity between studies. Knowing the performance, advantages and limitations of the RDTs, could facilitate the generation of a public policy based on testing and treatment in the first two trimesters of all pregnant women and also contribute to goal three of sustainable development goals of the United Nations Organization.This goal is to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being all ages, and includes one point that is to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1000 live births, by 2030 (United Nations 2016). To determine the diagnostic accuracy of rapid tests at point of care (POC) for detecting syphilis infection in pregnant women, as verified with the combination of both reactive non-treponemal and treponemal tests as the reference standard. To assess the accuracy of rapid POC testing according to type (non-treponemal and treponemal), infection stage (active versus inactive) and setting (low/middle-income vs high-income countries).In addition, we will to determine the diagnostic accuracy of POC test by brand without realize a formal comparison. We will include accuracy studies.Participants in included studies should have been enrolled under field conditions, prospectively and consecutively or through random sampling.Only studies reporting that all participants received the index test and the reference standard and presenting 2 \\u00d7 2 data will be eligible for inclusion.We will exclude diagnostic case-control studies, because the diagnosis of infection should not be known, before performing the diagnostic tests. We will include pregnant women, recruited at primary-or secondary-care facilities without previous diagnostic testing, who are attending an outpatient facility, or at the point of labour. Rapid tests at POC from whole blood, serum or plasma, regardless of the type of POC test (non-treponemal or treponemal) or technique (immunochromatographic, agglutination or any other technology). Syphilis at any infection stage (active versus inactive). A combination of both reactive non-treponemal (positive at any titre) and treponemal test (positive result). We will develop a highly-sensitive, systematic search strategy to identify as many relevant accuracy or validity studies, irrespective of their language, and publication status (published, unpublished, in press, and in progress).We will use both electronic searching in bibliographic databases and handsearching, as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011) . The results of all searches will be downloaded and managed using Endnote bibliographic so ware.Duplicate records of the same study will be deleted. We contacted the Information Specialist of the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) Review Group in order to implement a comprehensive search strategy to capture as many relevant studies as possible in electronic databases.For this purpose, we will use a combination of exploded controlled vocabulary (MeSH, Emtree, DeCS) and free-text terms (considering spelling variants, plurals, synonyms, acronyms and abbreviations) for the index tests (point-of-care test, point of care, point of care testing, point of care devices, point of care diagnostic, point of care laboratory, POC, POCT, rapid test, rapid test device, self testing, self test, patient self testing) and the target condition (syphilis, Treponema pallidum), with field labels, truncation, proximity operators and boolean operators.The search strategies and their results can be found in Appendix 1 (Electronic search strategies).Specifically, we will search the following electronic databases. \\u2022 MEDLINE, Ovid platform: inception to present. We will attempt to identify additional relevant studies by using of the following methods. \\u2022 Searching in the Cochrane STI Review Group's Specialized Register, which includes randomised controlled trials (RCTs) Two review authors (NT-M, LV-V) will independently selecting the titles and abstracts of studies retrieved as a result of the search.Disagreements will be resolved through consensus or, if required, by consultation with a third review author (CFG-A).We will retrieve the full text of a study if we have doubts about whether the study should be included or excluded.Two authors (EA-M, JA-G) will review independently the full text of selected articles in order to defined their inclusion.Disagreements will be resolved through consensus or, if required, by consultation with a third review author (CFG-A). We will design a data extraction form.For eligible studies, four review authors (JA-G, NT-M, EA-M, LV-V) will extract data independently using the form.Discrepancies will be resolved through consensus or, if required, by consultation with a fi h review author (CFG-A).The data extraction form will include the following information. \\u2022 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews unclear, we will contact the authors of the original reports to request further details. We will assess the quality of included articles by using a modified version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool (Whiting 2011).Two review authors (JA-G,EA-M ) will independently perform the quality assessment using the four key domains to assess risk of bias and concerns regarding the applicability to the research question (patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow-timing domains).We will score the papers as having a 'low', 'high' or 'unclear' risk of bias for each of four domains, and for the patient selection, index test and reference standard applicability.Studies classified at high or unclear risk of bias and/or high concern regarding applicability in at least one domain will be regarded as having low methodological design.The questions for these domains can be found in Appendix 2. In the case of disagreements, di erences will be resolved through consensus or by consultation with a third review author (CFG-A).The results will be presented in graphics according to each study an as a summary of all the studies. We will to assess the accuracy of all POC available test for detecting syphilis infection regardless their type: treponemal or non-treponemal.In this sense we plan to look at their accuracy grouped.On the other hand, because currently there are two common approaches to the diagnosis of syphilis using serological tests: the traditional algorithm (begins the screening with a nontreponemal test and confirms a positive result with a treponemal test) and the reverse algorithm (utilises a treponemal primary screening assay followed by a non-treponemal test if the primary treponemal assay is positive) we plan to report POC test accuracy using as gold standard both approaches grouped by type and sequence. We will summarise diagnostic test accuracy by creating a 2 \\u00d7 2 table for each study based on information retrieved directly from the papers.Each table will contain false positive, false negative, true positive, and true negative rates.Two review authors (CFG-A, JA-G) will independently enter the data into (Revman 2014 ).Discrepancies will be resolved by consensus or, if required, by consultation with a third review author (EA-M). In the first instance, we will analyse in a descriptive way all data retrieved from the included studies.For this purpose and given that results of the POC are reported qualitatively (positive or negative), we will present the results by plotting their sensitivity and specificity (and their 95% confidence intervals) both in forest plots and in a scatter plot in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space.For the meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy measures, we will use the bivariate model (Reitsma 2005) .For studies with a common threshold, this model takes into account withinstudy variation and between-study variation and focuses on estimating a summary operating point (i.e. a summary value for sensitivity and specificity).In addition, we will estimate the 95% confidence region and the 95% prediction region around the summary operating point.We will perform these analyses using the command xtmelogit in STATA, according to the licenses available. We will include a 'Summary of findings' table using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to diagnostic test accuracy (Hsu 2011) , using the template provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy (DTA) (Bossuyt 2013 ).We will present this summary table to provide a more accessible perspective of diagnostic information to healthcare providers and other end users. We will explore heterogeneity initially by performing visual inspection of forest plots of sensitivities and specificities and visual examination of the prediction region.We will formally assess the source of heterogeneity by examining di erences in diagnostic accuracy between subgroups of studies.Again, we will use the bivariate method to analyse how the summary estimate of sensitivity and specificity varies according to study level covariate.For this purpose, we will create a factor variable with N categories and will generate an N-1 dummy that will be entered into the bivariate model to test the e ects of covariate on both sensitivity and specificity (Macaskill 2010 ). We will define the sources of heterogeneity a priori and will include the following factors: POC type (non-treponemal and treponemal), infection stage (active versus inactive) and setting (low/middleincome vs high-income countries).In addition, we will to realize a subgroup analyses in order to determine the diagnostic accuracy of POC test by brand, without incurring a formal comparison. We will perform sensitivity analysis for aspects of the review that might a ect the results, such as risk of bias associated with the quality of included trials based on an overall 'Risk of bias' assessment (low versus unclear and high risk of bias) according to QUADAS-2 patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow-timing domains. We will investigate publication bias if we find 10 or more studies for inclusion in this systematic review.We will investigate reporting bias by using the natural logarithm of the DOR (lnDOR) and plot it against its variance or SE.We will assess asymmetry visually, and if asymmetry is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses using Deeks' test to investigate the asymmetry and using diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) as a measure of test accuracy (van Enst 2014).

Point of care rapid test for diagnosis of syphilis infection in pregnant women (Protocol)Copyright \\u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\",\n          \"A combination of two novel ligation techniques for complicated laparoscopic intraligamental myomectomy Objective: To perform laparoscopic myomectomy by combining two novel ligation techniques for a large lateral intraligamental myoma.Design: A step-by-step explanation of the surgical procedure using a video with narration.Setting: University hospital.Patient(s): A 39-year-old woman (gravida 1, para 0) presented with an asymptomatic pelvic mass.Sonographic imaging revealed a 10cm subserous myoma from the right lateral uterine isthmus wall.Laparoscopic exploration revealed a large myoma growing from the right lateral cervical isthmus wall toward the broad ligament.It was protruding into the pararectal space with duplicated ureters.Intervention(s): For such a large lateral intraligamental myoma, any conventional approach has the potential to cause massive bleeding and accidental injuries.We devised and implemented a preventative strategy for intraoperative bleeding by combining two novel ligation techniques used in laparoscopic myomectomy.We made an incision at the posterior leaf of the broad ligament and exposed the myometrium enveloping the fibroid and the base of the fibroid.Then we performed an incision 2 cm away from the right lower edge of the fibroid base, opening the myometrium and pseudocapsule.We applied two novel ligation techniques that ligate the pedicle on the left of the fibroid and the pseudocapsule on the right of the fibroid.Enucleation and loop tightening were implemented simultaneously.The entire pseudocapsule and most of the myometrium enveloping the fibroid were ligated in the loop knot.Only a small portion of the myometrium on the right side was outside the loop knot, which required electrocoagulation.Loop ligation was performed twice more for reinforcement in the same location.The peritoneum was then closed.Main Outcome Measure(s): Laparoscopic myomectomy was completed successfully for a large lateral intraligamental myoma using our novel technique.Result(s): The surgery lasted 110 min, and the volume of intraoperative blood loss was 150 mL.The patient had a normal postoperative course. Combining two novel ligation techniques in laparoscopic myomectomy is a safe and efficient surgical choice.This technique has obvious advantages in large, broad ligament myomas, reducing bleeding and avoiding unintentional injuries, even in duplicated ureters.Furthermore, this technique is not limited by the device and does not increase the cost of surgery.( \",\n          \"Perioperative pharmacological interventions for fetal immobilisation during fetal surgery and invasive procedures a We downgraded (2 Developments in ultrasound assessment of pregnancy has resulted in the increasing diagnosis of antenatal fetal issues.Many structural fetal conditions as well as complications associated with multiple pregnancies have the potential for in-utero treatment to improve both pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.Procedures such as laser ablation for twin-twin syndrome or cord occlusion for selective fetal termination require fetal immobilisation.Immobilisation of the fetus can occur through administration of medication to the mother or directly to the fetus.This improves procedural success and reduces the ongoing risk to the pregnancy.Evidence regarding the best medication and mode of delivery helps to ensure the optimal decision is made for both the mother and the fetus. To assess the e ects of perioperative pharmacological interventions for fetal immobilisation during fetal surgery and invasive procedures on fetal, neonatal, and maternal outcomes. We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (10 May 2021), and reference lists of retrieved studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (including published abstracts) which compared di erent classes of medication administered to the mother or fetus to allow in-utero procedures to be performed.We also included cluster-randomised trials but excluded cross-over trials. We used the standard Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth methods for data collection and analysis.Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked them for accuracy. One study with three trial reports met the inclusion criteria.This involved 54 women with a multiple pregnancy.The study was conducted in a tertiary European hospital maternal-fetal medicine unit and compared remifentanil to diazepam for fetal immobilisation and maternal sedation during fetoscopic surgery. Low-certainty evidence suggested that remifentanil may reduce fetal movement more than diazepam for two outcomes of fetal movement, one of fetal immobilisation at 40 minutes using a visual analogue score (VAS) (where 0 = immobile and 100 = baseline mobility), and one of gross body and limb movements (score was absolute number of movements), both assessed by a sonographer evaluating a taped ultrasound sequence (mean di erence (MD) -65.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -69.38 to -60.62 and MD -10.00, 95% 1 study, 50 women) . Surgeons may also report being more satisfied with the procedure when using remifentanil rather than diazepam (risk ratio (RR) 2.88, 95% CI 1.60 to 5.15; 1 study, 50 women; low-certainty evidence).However, maternal respiratory rate may decrease more during the surgical procedure with remifentanil compared with diazepam (MD -6.00, 95% CI -8.29 to -3.71; 1 study, 50 women; low-certainty evidence).Maternal sedation may also be worse with remifentanil compared with diazepam (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.65; 1 study, 50 women; low-certainty evidence) measured using an observer assessment of alertness/sedation (where a score of < 4 equates to profound sedation and > 4 equates to insu icient sedation).Perinatal mortality and time taken to perform the procedure were not reported in the trial. We prespecified 20 outcomes and planned to use GRADE for 6 of them, all other outcomes were not able to be reported against for the purpose of meta-analysis due to data not being provided or unable to be interpreted. We assessed the included study at low risk of selection bias (appropriate random sequence generation and allocation concealment), performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel), detection bias (outcome assessors were blinded), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data minimal), and reporting bias. Our GRADE assessment for certainty of the evidence indicates that there is low certainty of the evidence. We were only able to include one study with a small number of women, from a single centre, a European tertiary hospital.This study was published in 2005 with an abstract of this trial published in 2004.This study evaluated two intravenous medications administered to the mother -remifentanil and diazepam.This study reported our prespecified primary outcome but only evaluated several of our secondary outcomes, which limited further assessment.Low-certainty evidence suggested that remifentanil may be better at reducing fetal movements and surgeons were more satisfied with the procedure.However, maternal sedation and depression of breathing may be worse with remifentanil. Further high-quality RCTs assessing both fetal and maternal medications are required to evaluate their e icacy for fetal immobilisation as well as safety for both mother and fetus. We looked for evidence from randomised controlled trials on the e ectiveness of anaesthetic and pain relief medication for preventing fetal movements (fetal immobilisation) to allow surgical and other invasive procedures to be performed safely on the unborn fetus whilst still in the mother's uterus. Use of ultrasound during pregnancy has made great advances resulting in increased diagnosis of problems with the development of unborn babies.Many structural fetal problems as well as complications associated with multiple pregnancies can be treated while babies are still in the mother's uterus.Many problems generally require treatment before birth, for example a blockage in the airways.We set out to determine which medications are e ective at providing fetal immobilisation for in-utero procedures to be performed, as well as looking at the e ect on the mother in terms of sedation and pain relief.For these procedures to be performed safely, fetal movements may need to be reduced.This can be done by giving medication either to the mother (usually by injection into a vein) or directly to the fetus (by injecting into fetal muscle). Treatment of structural issues such as lung or heart problems can greatly improve pregnancy and newborn outcomes.Similarly, with multiple pregnancy complications such as twin-twin transfusion syndrome, where there is unequal sharing of the one placenta between the twins.Providing the best surgical conditions with reduced fetal movements means that the procedure can be performed safely and reduces complications such as preterm birth.It is also important to provide a safe environment for the mother without side e ects such as oversedation or lack of pain relief during the procedure. What evidence did we find? We searched for evidence from randomised controlled trials to May 2021 and identified one eligible trial involving 54 pregnant women.All were women with a multiple pregnancy in their second trimester attending a European hospital for specialist care.The women received intravenous injection of either remifentanil or diazepam to immobilise the fetus and to sedate the mother during fetoscopic surgery.This is where a small instrument (laparoscope) is inserted through the mother's abdominal wall and into the uterus to see the fetus and placenta.The trial gave low-certainty evidence.The main outcome looked at was how much the baby moved via assessment of body and limb movements.Maternal outcomes were the amount of sedation and depression of breathing.The time for surgery and surgical satisfaction with the procedural conditions were also measured.Low-certainty evidence suggested that remifentanil may be better at reducing fetal movements when compared to diazepam and surgeons were more satisfied with the procedure when using remifentanil.However, the amount of maternal sedation and depression of breathing were worse with remifentanil. Low-certainty evidence from one small trial means that we cannot be confident in the results.The information available on maternal, fetal, and newborn outcomes was limited.More high-quality trials are needed to increase our certainty about the longer term fetal and newborn impact of the medication used for fetal immobilisation for in-utero procedures, as well as other medications which may be suitable for use.Moderate certainty: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.Low certainty: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.Very low certainty: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews B A C K G R O U N D The increasing use of advanced ultrasound technologies, in combination with increased multiple pregnancy rates globally and the development of novel procedures to address fetal problems in utero has resulted in more invasive fetal procedures and surgeries being performed during pregnancy.Fetal conditions that may be suitable for in-utero interventions include fetal tumours, lung and airway lesions, cardiac abnormalities, urinary tract abnormalities, and complications associated with monochorionic twin pregnancies.Increasing diagnosis of severe and lifethreatening fetal conditions has also resulted in more frequent termination of pregnancy. Congenital abnormalities of the urinary tract are relatively common (1/250 to 1000 pregnancies) (Ruano 2011) .Bilateral ureteric or bladder outflow obstruction carries a particularly poor prognosis.Without intervention, LUTO has a perinatal mortality rate of 90% and more than 50% of survivors require renal dialysis or transplantation (Ruano 2011) .Therapeutic interventions include vesicocentesis (draining the fetal bladder with a needle), vesicoamniotic shunting (placing a tube from the bladder into the amniotic cavity) (Kilby 2013) , and fetal cystoscopy (looking at the fetal bladder with a small camera), which can both diagnose and treat posterior urethral valves.Fetal cystoscopy requires maternal epidural or local anaesthesia combined with direct fetal administration of anaesthetic agents (Ruano 2011) .Despite inutero treatment of these conditions, there is ongoing concern regarding the long-term renal function for children with the above conditions (Cheung 2019). Fetal lung lesions, most commonly congenital cystic adenomatous malformations, bronchopulmonary sequestration (CPAM) or 'hybrid' lesions, occur in 1/10,000 to 35,000 pregnancies (Witlox 2011) .CPAM account for 30% to 40% of all diagnosed congenital lung malformations (Zobel 2019) .While many of these may regress over the course of pregnancy, they may be associated with severe fetal compromise leading to the need for in-utero procedures.These procedures include thoracocentesis (ultrasound-guided needle drainage), thoraco-amniotic shunting (placing a tube from the cyst cavity inside the chest to the amniotic cavity), ultrasoundguided laser coagulation of the arteries that supply the lesion, and open surgical resection of severe lesions (Witlox 2011) .Advances in fetal treatment options have improved survival rates to around 95% (Zobel 2019) .Fetoscopic tracheal occlusion procedures (plugging of the fetal trachea) have been advocated to induce growth and expansion of the hypoplastic (underdeveloped) lung (Van de Velde 2012). Congenital diaphragmatic hernias occur in approximately 1:4000 pregnancies with le -sided defects more common than right (Dolk 2010) .These defects o en result in abdominal contents herniating into the thoracic cavity causing fetal lung hypoplasia and resultant neonatal respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension with a significant risk of mortality.In-utero fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion (FETO) performed early in the third trimester has shown to significantly improve survival and neonatal outcomes (Deprest 2021) . Fetal heart lesions that may be suitable for intracardiac intervention during pregnancy include stenotic valvular lesions (where there is a critical narrowing of the heart valve), in addition to some other more complicated structural anomalies.In-utero interventions aim to facilitate both the growth and functioning of the heart (Artz 2011) .However, due to the complexity of fetal cardiac abnormalities only approximately 5% of those with major congenital heart disease (CHD) are likely to benefit from in-utero treatment (Gardiner 2019). A range of spinal lesions can be detected by perinatal ultrasound.Myelomeningocele, the most severe form of spina bifida, may be associated with significant complications including hindbrain herniation, hydrocephalus, as well as both sensory, motor, and bowel/urinary dysfunction (Kabagambe 2018) .In-utero treatment with closure of the spinal defect reduces the duration of time the spinal cord is exposed to amniotic fluid.This is superior to neonatal treatment with improved outcomes, including mental development and motor function, for those who receive in-utero correction (Adzick 2011) . Sampling of fetal blood via cordocentesis, also known as percutaneous umbilical blood sampling, allows increased diagnostic accuracy for many fetal conditions including fetal anaemia, hydrops, neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, and fetal genetic disorders.The ability to access fetal vasculature in utero may enable timely treatment during pregnancy, most commonly fetal red blood cell or platelet transfusions (Fox 2012) . Monochorionic twin pregnancies share the same placental mass and due to vascular connections there may be discordance in blood supply to each twin, which can result in twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS).TTTS occurs in up to 15% of monochorionic twin pregnancies, and untreated has a mortality rate of 90% (Chalouhi 2011) .Treatment may involve selective laser coagulation of placental vessels, which involves performing an in-utero procedure (Roberts 2008) . All types of multiple pregnancy are at risk for 'selective' structural and chromosomal anomalies.As mentioned, monochorionic twin pairs are at particular risk for TTTS and also selective growth restriction.In some of these situations one option for management might be to selectively 'reduce' the fetus with the poor or poorest prognosis in order to prolong pregnancy or to improve outcomes for the remaining fetus/es.Selective reduction procedures all require a fetal intervention and thus fetal immobilisation is an important part of such a procedure.In some settings, for example, late termination of pregnancy with a singleton fetus, feticide prior to induction of labour may be o ered/performed. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Fetal interventions performed during pregnancy may involve open fetal surgery with maternal laparotomy, obstetric endoscopy (fetoscopy), and ultrasound-guided needling techniques.During these procedures described above, movement of the fetus increases the technical di iculty of the procedure and may contribute to trauma, as well as increasing the required operating time.Whilst there is much debate surrounding the perception of pain in the fetus, pain transmission can be demonstrated in controlled settings from approximately 16 weeks' gestation, and these pathways are completely developed from 26 weeks.With the recognition of a fetal stress response in response to procedures and in particular to noxious stimuli, e ective fetal anaesthesia and analgesia may modify the fetal response, improve fetal outcome and possibly limit preterm labour (Anand 2001; Brusseau 2013) . Various methods and routes of administration have been utilised to aid in fetal immobilisation and provide both anaesthesia and analgesia.These include transplacental routes (maternal general anaesthesia and other maternal medications), and combined spinal epidural and local anaesthesia with direct fetal administration of analgesic/anaesthetic medications (intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), or intra-amniotic) (Fink 2011 ). To date, although the literature describes various routes of administration, their relative advantages and disadvantages and commonly used doses of medication, little is known about shortand long-term safety for the fetus a er such medications are given (Brusseau 2013) .Even simple pharmacokinetic profiles are poorly described for most agents, with the volatile agents best described, for example, isoflurane levels in the fetus reach 70% of maternal levels a er 60 minutes of administration (Brusseau 2013) . At this time in clinical practice, the choice of anaesthetic and analgesic agents, their dose, and the mode of administration are ultimately determined by the procedure performed, clinical experience, and the medical condition of the fetus. Open fetal surgery is used for repair of severe fetal lung lesions, and severe spine and spinal cord lesions (such as myelomeningocoele (Adzick 2011 ) and sacral teratomas) (Schwarz 2003) .It requires maternal general anaesthesia (with or without epidural anaesthesia), and fetal anaesthesia, which can be achieved by placental transfer of anaesthetic agents administered to the mother, or additional administration of fetal opioids and muscle relaxants (Van de Velde 2012).There appears to be little consensus on the most appropriate agents for maternal general anaesthesia.Epidural anaesthesia and IV induction agents (thiopental, propofol, etomidate, and ketamine), as well as volatile anaesthetics (inhaled gases, e.g.halothane and isoflurane) have all been used in pregnancy.Newer volatile agents (desflurane, seroflurane) have not yet been studied, but it has been hypothesised that they will undergo rapid placental transfer to the fetus (Tran 2010) .Other agents that are used for their ability to induce both maternal and fetal anaesthesia include thiopental, propofol, diazepam, morphine, remifentanil, and midazolam (Tran 2010) . Most fetoscopic surgery is well tolerated under maternal local anaesthesia, although maternal regional anaesthesia (spinal, epidural, or combined spinal epidural) is o en used for complex procedures.Combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia provide neither fetal immobilisation or anaesthesia, so additional agents are required (IV maternal agents, or fetal IM/IV opioids and muscle relaxants) (Van de Velde 2012).Agents that have been studied in this setting include remifentanil (a short-acting potent opioid), diazepam, or propofol administered to the woman.Alternative strategies to immobilise the fetus involve the direct administration of anaesthetic agents to the fetus, including fentanyl and pancuronium (either IM or IV into the umbilical vein) (Ruano 2011) .For situations that require complete fetal immobilisation, direct fetal administration of fentanyl, vecuronium, and atropine is o en required. To ensure an in-utero procedure is successful a medication must be chosen that provides a combination of three pharmacological aspects -analgesia, anaesthesia, and paralysis.The type and level of complexity of the procedure being performed and the degree of immobilisation required contributes to which medication may be chosen.For example, complete immobilisation is required as well as providing analgesia/anaesthesia for the fetus during fetal blood sampling.However, some movement may in fact be advantageous to gain access to the placental vessels when performing laser procedures for the treatment of twin-twin syndrome. Successful fetal anaesthesia and analgesia reduce fetal movements, which in turn may result in a reduction in fetal trauma during surgery, reduced surgical technical di iculty with increased surgical success, and shorter operating times.Furthermore, fetal anaesthesia and analgesia may reduce the fetal stress response to painful stimuli, and may prevent long-term adverse neurodevelopmental and behavioural responses to pain (Fink 2011) . It is also important to consider how a medication may a ect the woman with evaluation of maternal sedation versus no sedation as well as maternal analgesia/anaesthesia versus none.A safe maternal environment is required to ensure there is no subsequent fetal harm. The increasing frequency of fetal surgery and other interventions during pregnancy requires the assessment of perioperative pharmacological interventions during fetal surgery and invasive procedures. To assess the e ects of perioperative pharmacological interventions for fetal immobilisation during fetal surgery and invasive procedures on fetal, neonatal, and maternal outcomes. Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared the following interventions: maternal sedation versus no sedation, maternal analgesia/anaesthesia versus nothing, fetal paralysis versus nothing, combinations versus nothing, one intervention versus another. Trials using a cross-over design or cluster-randomised trials were not included.We included studies presented as abstracts if enough information was presented for us to make an assessment. Women with fetal conditions undergoing invasive fetal interventions or fetal surgery including fetal blood sampling and transfusion, fetal bladder drainage and stenting, fetal pleural e usion drainage and stenting, fetoscopy for laser ablation to treat twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, fetal tracheal occlusion, fetal spina bifida repair and EXIT procedure. \\u2022 Maternal sedation versus no sedation. \\u2022 Maternal analgesia/anaesthesia versus no analgesia/ anaesthesia.\\u2022 Fetal paralysis versus no fetal paralysis. \\u2022 Combinations versus nothing. \\u2022 One intervention versus another.

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register by contacting their Information Specialist (10 May 2021). The Register is a database containing over 25,000 reports of controlled trials in the field of pregnancy and childbirth.It represents over 30 years of searching.For full current search methods used to populate Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register including the detailed search strategies for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL; the list of handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness service, please follow this link. Briefly, Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register is maintained by their Information Specialist and contains trials identified from: 1. monthly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); 2. weekly searches of MEDLINE (Ovid); 3. weekly searches of Embase (Ovid); 4. monthly searches of CINAHL (EBSCO); 5. handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major conferences; 6. weekly current awareness alerts for a further 44 journals plus monthly BioMed Central email alerts. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Search results are screened by two people and the full text of all relevant trial reports identified through the searching activities described above is reviewed.Based on the intervention described, each trial report is assigned a number that corresponds to a specific Pregnancy and Childbirth review topic (or topics), and is then added to the Register.The Information Specialist searches the Register for each review using this topic number rather than keywords.This results in a more specific search set that has been fully accounted for in the relevant review sections (Included studies; Excluded studies; Studies awaiting classification; Ongoing studies). In addition, we searched ClinicalTrials.govand the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for unpublished, planned, and ongoing trial reports (10 May 2021) using the search methods detailed in Appendix 1. We searched reference lists of retrieved studies. We have not applied any language restrictions. The following methods section is based on a standard template used by Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth. Two review authors have independently assessed for inclusion all the potential studies we identified as a result of the search strategy.We resolved any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we consulted a third person. We created a study flow diagram to map out the number of records identified, included, excluded, or awaiting classification. All studies meeting our inclusion criteria have been evaluated by two review authors against predefined criteria to select studies that, based on available information, are deemed to be su iciently trustworthy to be included in the analysis.The criteria areas follow. \\u2022 Are there any retraction notices or expressions of concern listed on the Retraction Watch Database relating to this study? \\u2022 Was the study prospectively registered (for those studies published a er 2010)?If not, have the authors provided a plausible reason?\\u2022 When requested, did the trial authors provide/share the protocol or ethics approval letter or both?\\u2022 Did the trial authors engage in communication with Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth within the agreed timelines?\\u2022 Did the trial authors provide individual participant data (IPD) upon request?If not, was there a plausible reason? \\u2022 Is the study free from characteristics of the study participants that appear too similar (e.g.distribution of the mean (standard deviation (SD)) excessively narrow or excessively wide, as noted by Carlisle 2017)? \\u2022 Is the study free from characteristics that could be implausible (e.g.large numbers of women with a rare condition recruited from a single centre within 12 months)?\\u2022 In cases with (close to) zero losses to follow-up, is there a plausible explanation? \\u2022 Is the study free from results that could be implausible (e.g.massive risk reduction for main outcomes with small sample size)?\\u2022 Do the numbers randomised to each group suggest that adequate randomisation methods were used (e.g. is the study free from issues such as unexpectedly even numbers of women 'randomised', including a mismatch between the numbers and the methods, equal number of randomised participants when 'no blocking was used', or if the authors say they used 'blocks of 4' but the final numbers di er by 6)? \\u2022 Studies assessed as being potentially 'high risk' have not been included in the review.Where a study was classified as 'high risk' for one or more of the above criteria, we attempted to contact the study authors to address any possible lack of information/ concerns.If adequate information remained unavailable, the study would remain in 'awaiting classification' and the reasons and communications with the author (or lack of) described in detail. The process is described in Figure 1 . We have designed a form to extract data.For eligible studies, at least two review authors have extracted the data using the agreed form.We have resolved discrepancies through discussion, or, as required, through consultation with a third person.We entered data into Review Manager 5 so ware (RevMan 5) and checked for accuracy (Review Manager 2020).When information regarding any of the above was unclear, we attempted to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details. Two review authors have independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011) .We resolved any disagreement by discussion or by involving a third assessor. We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in su icient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups. We assessed the method as: \\u2022 low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g.random number table, computer random number generator); \\u2022 high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g.odd or even date of birth, hospital or clinic record number); \\u2022 unclear risk of bias. We described for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assessed whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed a er assignment. We assessed the methods as: \\u2022 low risk of bias (e.g.telephone or central randomisation, consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); \\u2022 high risk of bias (open random allocation, unsealed or nonopaque envelopes, alternation, date of birth); \\u2022 unclear risk of bias. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received.We considered that studies were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding would be unlikely to a ect results.We assessed blinding separately for di erent outcomes or classes of outcomes. We assessed the methods as: \\u2022 low, high, or unclear risk of bias for participants; \\u2022 low, high, or unclear risk of bias for personnel. We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received.We assessed blinding separately for di erent outcomes or classes of outcomes. We assessed methods used to blind outcome assessment as: \\u2022 low, high, or unclear risk of bias. We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis.We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.Where su icient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we have re-included missing data in the analyses which we undertook. We assessed methods as: \\u2022 low risk of bias (e.g.no missing outcome data, missing outcome data balanced across groups); \\u2022 high risk of bias (e.g.numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups, 'as treated' analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation); \\u2022 unclear risk of bias. We have described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We have assessed the methods as: \\u2022 low risk of bias (where it was clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); \\u2022 high risk of bias (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported, one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified, outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used, study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); \\u2022 unclear risk of bias. We have described for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias. We have assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias: \\u2022 low risk of other bias; \\u2022 high risk of other bias; \\u2022 unclear whether there was risk of other bias. We have made explicit judgements about whether studies are at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011) .With reference to 1. to 6. above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we consider it is likely to impact on the findings.We had planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses. For dichotomous data, we presented results as summary risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals. For continuous data, we used the mean di erence if outcomes were measured in the same way between trials.We would use the standardised mean di erence to combine trials that measured the same outcome, but used di erent methods. We did not identify any cluster-randomised trials for inclusion in this review.In future, if we identify any such trials we plan to include them in our analysis along with individually-randomised trials using the methods previously outlined.Where multiple pregnancies were assessed the movements of only one twin were recorded and assessed for the study outcomes. For included studies, levels of attrition were noted.In future updates, if more eligible studies are included, the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment e ect will be explored by using sensitivity analysis. For all outcomes, analyses were carried out, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses.The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing. We planned to assess statistical heterogeneity in each metaanalysis using the Tau , I , and Chi statistics.We have regarded heterogeneity as substantial if I was greater than 30% and either Tau was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi test for heterogeneity. In future updates of this review, if there are 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis, we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots.We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually.If asymmetry is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate it. We carried out statistical analysis using RevMan 5 (Review Manager 2020) .This review contains one included study, therefore metaanalysis was not possible.We planned to use fixed-e ect metaanalysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment e ect: i.e.where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials' populations and methods were judged su iciently similar.If there was clinical heterogeneity su icient to expect that the underlying treatment e ects di ered between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we would have used random-e ects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment e ect across trials was considered clinically meaningful.The random-e ects summary would be treated as the average of the range of possible treatment e ects, and we have discussed the clinical implications of treatment e ects di ering between trials.If the average treatment e ect was not clinically meaningful we would not combine trials. If we had identified substantial heterogeneity, we planned to investigate it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses.We planned to consider whether an overall summary is meaningful, and if it so, use random-e ects analysis to produce it. We planned to carry out the following subgroup analyses but were not able to do so due to the small amount of data available from one trial: \\u2022 type of procedure performed; \\u2022 gestational age at the time the procedure was performed; \\u2022 singleton pregnancy versus multiple pregnancy; \\u2022 di erent routes of administration -for example, fetal intramuscular injection versus fetal umbilical vein injection. The following outcome would have been used in subgroup analysis: \\u2022 degree of fetal immobilisation as defined by trial authors. We planned to assess subgroup di erences by interaction tests available within RevMan 5 (Review Manager 2020), reporting the results of subgroup analyses quoting the Chi statistic and P value, and the interaction test I value. Sensitivity analyses were not able to be performed due to the inclusion of a single trial. In future updates, we will perform sensitivity analysis to explore the e ects of trial quality by omitting studies rated as 'high risk of bias' on overall assessment.We will restrict this to the primary outcome. In particular, as quasi-randomised trials are eligible to be included, we plan to perform a sensitivity analysis on the basis of excluding such trials. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach, as outlined in the GRADE handbook.We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes: 1. degree of fetal immobilisation as defined by trial authors; 2. technically successful procedure as defined by trial authors; 3. time taken to perform the planned procedure; 4. perinatal mortality; 5. maternal respiratory depression as defined by trial authors; 6. maternal sedation measured using sedation scores as defined by trial authors. GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool was used to import data from RevMan 5 (Review Manager 2020) in order to create summary of findings tables.A summary of the intervention e ect and a measure of certainty for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. We included one study with two trial reports (Van de Velde 2005) in the review.See Included studies. See Figure 2 . Our search retrieved at total of 174 records, from which 162 were excluded as they were not a trial or were not within the specified scope, see Figure 2 . We assessed 12 trial reports.We included one trial (three reports) and excluded six (eight reports).One trial is ongoing. We applied the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth trustworthiness screening tool (CPC-TST) to the included study Van de Velde 2005.Specifically, upon assessment, there were no concerns regarding research governance (no retractions, prospective registration not required as published before 2005, and no requirement as yet to share protocol).Baseline characteristics and feasibility seemed appropriate, as did the results. We included one study with three trial reports (Van de Velde 2005) in the review.See Included studies. The included study is a double-blind randomised controlled trial. There were 54 women in the included study.Four women were excluded from the study, with the remaining 50 women administered either medication. The included study was conducted in tertiary European hospitals within a high-risk maternal-fetal medicine unit.The included study did not report the trial dates.Funding sources were reported as follows: grants from European Commission (Euro Twin 2 Twin), and also in part by a 2002 Society of Anesthesia and Reanimation of Belgium (SARB) grant for experimental research.Declarations of interest of trial authors were not reported. All women in the included study were in their second trimester with multiple pregnancy.The demographic and clinical characteristics of women in Van de Velde 2005 were similar between groups.Most women included in this study were undergoing laser treatment for twin-twin syndrome.A smaller proportion of women were undergoing intervention for selective cord occlusion. The included study compared maternally administered intravenous remifentanil versus diazepam to achieve fetal immobilisation and maternal sedation.Maternal sedation, haemodynamics, side e ects as well as fetal haemodynamics and immobilisation were evaluated at several time points during the procedure. Remifentanil and diazepam were assessed in regard to both fetal and maternal outcomes.When fetal outcomes were assessed, they were reported for only the mobile twin in cases of twintwin syndrome, and only movements of the normal fetus were recorded in pregnancies where selective feticide/cord occlusion was performed. This study assessed whether remifentanil was superior to diazepam to achieve maternal sedation without respiratory depression along with measurement of maternal pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), and respiratory rate. Level of fetal immobilisation was assessed via a visual analogue score (VAS) as well as documenting the number of gross body and limb movements. Length of operating time and surgical satisfaction was assessed to determine which medication was superior. A er examining the abstract or full text, we excluded six studies from this review.Four papers were excluded as they either compared the same drug with di erent doses, used medications within the same class, or did not administer any medication to either the mother or the fetus (ACTRN12617000098336; Han 2015; Mouw 1999; van Scheltema 2011).One study was excluded as their inclusion criteria for in-utero complications/procedures was too varied with only small numbers in each category (Fan 1994). One study was excluded as it assessed fetal MRI rather than an in-utero procedure (EUCTR2009-011281-28-BE).For further detail see Excluded studies. Details of the risk of bias assessment for the included study are presented in Characteristics of included studies.Summary description of the assessments is presented in Figure 3 . Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews We judged the included study to have low risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment. We judged our included study Van de Velde 2005 to have low risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) as well as for blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias).In this study both the woman, obstetrician, and anaesthetist were blinded to the sedative used, with an external/third assessor used to confirm results (the assessor was also blinded). We judged Van de Velde 2005 to have a low risk of attrition bias as there were low rates of incomplete data reported. We judged Van de Velde 2005 to have a low risk of reporting bias. There were no other bias identified for Van de Velde 2005.

One trial Van de Velde 2005 with three reports, involving 54 women, was included in this review.This trial compared remifentanil to diazepam (i.e. one intervention versus another).We did not find any other studies to assess any of the other comparisons that had been prespecified when planning the review.Therefore, meta-analysis was not possible. Four women were excluded due to fetuses that were immobile at the beginning of the surgery.The remaining 50 women were randomised to either remifentanil or diazepam. Our planned prespecified comparisons included: maternal sedation versus no sedation, maternal analgesia/anaesthesia versus no analgesia/anaesthesia, fetal paralysis versus no fetal paralysis, combinations versus nothing, and one intervention versus another. The comparison utilised in this one included trial, fits under our prespecified comparison category of one intervention versus another.As diazepam is a sedative (benzodiazepine class) and remifentanil is an analgesic, the comparison is of maternal sedation versus maternal analgesia/anaesthesia.There were therefore no other comparisons that could be included/reported in our review. Our primary outcome was degree of fetal immobilisation as defined by trial authors.The authors of the trial assessed fetal mobility in two ways -by taping fetal movement with ultrasound with subsequent evaluation by sonographer and providing a score, and also counting the gross body and limb movements: \\\"Fetal mobility was assessed, before, during, and a er surgery by taping 5minute ultrasound sequences of fetal movement every 20 minutes throughout surgery and 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes a er the end of surgery.These sequences were evaluated by an experienced ultrasonographer.Two types of evaluation were performed: a VAS score for mobility (0 = immobile and 100 = baseline mobility) (which the authors also refer to as 'fetal immobilisation score') and the number of gross body movements and limb movements per 5-minute period (number of fetal movements).\\\"In this clinical situation a lower score for both parameters would be more favourable, as a less mobile fetus will facilitate a more successful procedure. When aligning the trials outcomes with our prespecified outcome, we chose to use the fetal mobility assessment 40-minute time point, as it was in the middle of the surgical time frame and also data extraction from the paper was feasible as clearly stated in writing (other data were only reported on graphs and could not be extracted). The results suggested that remifentanil may result in less fetal movement (i.e. more fetal immobilisation), when compared with diazepam, as evaluated by the fetal immobilisation score (subjective surgical and objective ultrasound scores) (mean di erence (MD) -65.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -69.38 to -60.62; 1 study, 50 women; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.1). The number of fetal movements may be decreased from 18 \\u00b1 3 to 2 \\u00b1 1 at 40 minutes of surgery in the remifentanil group, with a much smaller e ect on fetal movement reduction in the diazepam group (MD -10.00, 95% CI -11.62 to -8.38; 1 study, 50 women; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.2). Technically successful procedure as defined by trial authors In addition to the evaluation of fetal immobilisation by sonographers reviewing taped periods of the procedure on ultrasound, evaluation of fetal mobility and the procedure was also performed by the surgeon and assessed on a four-point scale: \\\"At the end of the intervention the surgeon assessed overall fetal immobility and operating conditions using a four-point scale, this subjective score represented an overall subjective impression and is further referred to as the surgical assessment/satisfaction score, 1 = excellent, 2 = good, 3 = moderate and 4 = inadequate immobilisation.\\\" We have chosen to use the reported outcome of 'surgical assessment/satisfaction score' and align with our prespecified outcome of technically successful procedure. The results suggest that the surgical assessment/satisfaction score may be better in the remifentanil group.It was assessed by the surgeon as being good to excellent (score of 1 or 2) in 92% of women in the remifentanil group, whereas this was 32% in the diazepam group (risk ratio (RR) 2.88, 95% CI 1.60 to 5.15; 1 study, 50 women; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.3). The included study did not report this outcome nor any data that we could utilise to report on it. Van de Velde 2005 reported that the time to complete the surgery was significantly longer in the diazepam group, 80 (60 to 90) minutes versus 60 (54 to 71) minutes in the remifentanil group.The included data were only reported with medians/ranges and thus were not suitable for analysis, nor able to be included in further tables, and are reported narratively. For many of our prespecified outcomes, we were either unable to extract or utilise reported data from Van de Velde 2005 or the outcome was not reported at all by the study authors.For clarity, we have listed all our prespecified outcomes below and explained. Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews diazepam.This study reported our prespecified primary outcome but only evaluated several of our secondary outcomes, which limited further assessment. We assessed the included study at low risk of selection bias (appropriate random sequence generation and allocation concealment), performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel), detection bias (outcome assessors were blinded), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data minimal), and reporting bias.We downgraded (2) levels for very serious imprecision due to data only being available from a single small study of 50 women. Our GRADE assessment for certainty of the evidence is that there is low certainty of the evidence (see Summary of findings 1) for all the findings reported. We adhered to the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group search strategies and review processes.Two review authors independently selected potential studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data to minimise potential biases. To our knowledge there are no other studies or reviews addressing the e ectiveness and harms of di erent types and routes of anaesthesia or analgesia for fetal immobilisation for in-utero procedures. Low-certainty evidence suggested that remifentanil may be better at reducing fetal movements and surgeons were more satisfied with the procedure.However, maternal sedation and depression of breathing may be worse with remifentanil.However, these data were from a single small study, and this limits our ability to make definitive conclusions. Due to the low certainty of the evidence for our main outcomes, the e ects of pharmacological interventions for fetal immobilisation in the management of fetal surgery and invasive procedures are uncertain. There is a need for well-designed, multicentre, randomised controlled trials to evaluate the e ectiveness and safety of di erent types and routes of anaesthesia and analgesia to achieve fetal immobilisation for in-utero procedures.We suggest that future studies measure important outcomes listed in this review.
